        "Former gangster/convict and biker James McDonald, legendary gangster rapper MC Eiht and music insider Norm Steele, bring you \"The Gangster Chronicles\". The Gangster Chronicles is a weekly long form conversation with everyone from gangsters, police and bank robbers, to rappers, politicians and former d boys. The Gangster Chronicles gives you a glimpse into the world of those that live their lives outside of society's normal parameters, where the risk are high, but the rewards are astronomical. We conversate with the real Tony Montana's of the world, but we don't glorify or sensationalize these lifestyles, we simply examine the circumstances that may have influenced their decisions. Every gangster has a story and they all have a different ending.
